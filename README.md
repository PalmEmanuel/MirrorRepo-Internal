# MirrorRepo-Internal

Issues created in the repo [PalmEmanuel/MirrorRepo-Core](https://github.com/PalmEmanuel/MirrorRepo-Core) will be mirrored here, as a presentation demo of how to use GitHub Apps in GitHub Actions for cross-repository automation.

Demos use [StageCoder](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EngstromJimmy.stagecoderVSCode) during the presentation.
